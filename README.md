# Installation

This project requires a Python3 interpreter with Tkinter support.
You can test it using

```sh
python3 -m tkinter
```

In case your (GNU/Linux) machine does not support tkinter, there's a way to run it inside Docker (whereas you can also use another base image than `ubuntu`):

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt update && apt install -y python3-tk x11-apps
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code
ADD . /code
CMD ["/usr/bin/python3", "-m", "quiet"]
```

Now, expose an environment variable to allow access to your host system `XAUTH="$HOME/.Xauthority"` and build the image using `docker build -t quiet .`.
You can start a container using

```sh
docker run --network=host --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v $XAUTH:/root/.Xauthority quiet
```

Be aware, that the Docker container has full access to your machine! So you better trust the executed code.
